        <li>Stonewall Uprising</li>
        <p>
          On June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street, things turned violent after a
          few LGBTQ people were arrested on questionable charges. The LGBTQ community was irritated being targeted by the police.
          These public arrests incited rioting that spilled over into the neighboring streets and lasted several days.
          These events have been described as a “riot,” a “rebellion,” a “protest,” and an “uprising.” Whatever the label, this was
          undoubtedly a historical moment in LGBT history.
          And Marsha P. Johnson was one of the most significant figure in Stonewall Uprising.
